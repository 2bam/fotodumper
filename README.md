# FOTODUMPER v2.3
**[INSTRUCCIONES EN ESPAÑOL](LEAME.md)**

Based on fotodumper by @armdz

Download entire http://fotolog.com account. Photos, comments, and extra data. Saved as json, ready to parse and visualize.
ALSO INCLUDES "protolog", a very simple html fotolog like visualizer.

This version intends to be more robust against fotolog's errors and server discrepancies (you wouldn't believe how many there are).
It can continue from where you left or failed. The downloaded files are in a folder thats is named as the fotolog account, with all the files inside.
You access protolog opening `index.html`

# USAGE
`node fotodump.js fotolog-username`

Run it multiple times if it fails.

## Detailed howto

* _(In Windows)_ Right click holding the SHIFT key inside the unzipped folder and click "Open command window here"
